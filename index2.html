                <p>Hello, my name is Agne. I am a Vedic Astrologer and Soul formula consultant. I’ve been interested in
                    Astrology since my teenage years, when I was going through the books of Astrology, Chirology and
                    Numerology that I took from my mother.<br><br></p>
                <p>Although I graduated in economics and business management at University and worked in banking and
                    finance all my life, two years ago Astrology suddenly came back into my life. I wanted to know
                    myself, I was curious to find out what I am like, what influence the celestial bodies in the
                    Universe have on me, what gifts they gave me at my birth day and how they affect me on a daily
                    basis. After completing a course in Vedic Astrology and the Soul formula, I decided to not only use
                    the knowledge I had gained for myself, but also to share it with others.</p> <br>
                <p>I believe that Astrology can help us to know and understand ourselves better and explain why we
                    behave in certain ways and why certain things happen at certain times or in certain areas of life.
                    Once we know this, we can breathe a sigh of relief and reassurance that all is well with us - that
                    each person is unique and extraordinary, and that the celestial bodies and the universe have
                    prepared a bouquet of gifts for us to receive and enjoy.</p>

                <p>Personal formula according to the Aleksandr Astrogor’s methodology</p>
                Aleksandr Astrogor - author of the book "The Soul Formula" - defines the soul formula as God's stamp in
                our life passport, which captures the totality of a person's innate qualities, vocation, path of
                development and lessons. The main question is: Who are you, human being? The planets at the center of
                the formula represent the core of the human being, revealing his or her strongest natural character
                traits and talents.


            </div>

            <div class="scroll-element2 js-scroll2 slide-right2">The Soul Formula reveals how a person interacts with
                the people around him, what professions he would be suited to, what health problems he should beware of,
                what kind of partner he is most suited to and what he is subconsciously seeking.<br><br>
